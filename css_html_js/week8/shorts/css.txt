If HTML is used to organize the content we put on our pages, CSS is used to customize the website's look and feel. Style sheets are written directly into your HTML (place them in <style> tags
in your page's head). Style sheets can also be written as separate CSS files and linked to your document (use <link href="X" rel="stylesheet" /> tags in your page's head to accomplish this).

body                <-- beginning of style sheet (selector)
{
    -- List key value pairs here --
    background-color: blue;     <-- declaration
}


#unique               <-- selector for IDs. Applies to all HTML tags with the "#unique" identifier
{
    -- Code --
}

.students               <-- selector for classes. Applies to all HTML tags with identical class attributes
{
    -- Code --
}
