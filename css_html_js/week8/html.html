<!--- When we visit a website requesting a specific homepage or a specific file, HTML (hypertext markup language) exists beyond the HTTP headers. HTML contains two main concepts:
tags/elements
attributes

Here is a simple webpage we can make. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">        <!--- Here is the beginning of the webpage (open tag); attribute "lang" attaches to tag "html", tells browser contents of webpage are to be in English --->
    <head>              <!--- Child of HTML parent tag --->
        <title>
            hello, title
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        hello, body
    </body>
</html>                 <!--- Close tag for line 1 --->

<!--- When our webpage gets parsed by the computer top to bottom left to right, the webpage as text gets loaded into our computer's memory as a data structure.

Note that if you were to download an html file you would be the only one to access it locally, so to allow other people to see your work you must host it on a webserver. The CS50 IDE has that
functionality built in, so you may simply enter http-server into the terminal window to run an html file.

This will start a second server in parallel to the one the IDE is running on, and will generate a URL for which you may click into. There you should find your html file to view in your browser.
