<!--- Here we have a modification of queryselector.html, wherein we have an anonymous function that gets called when the website content is fully loaded, and then another anonymous function that
gets called to greet the user.

Note that javascript has a similar function to a Python print(f"{}") string, which is just as follows: `___ ${variable_name}`.
