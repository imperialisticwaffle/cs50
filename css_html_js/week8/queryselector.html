<!--- The world of programming is full of events (clicking on a page, touching a page on a phone, submitting a form, etc).
Using javascript we can now write code that listens for these events using addEventListener('item to listen for', action_when_heard).

Note that you have to define 'form' first before accessing it; currently it is accessed on line 13 before it is defined on line 21.

While we could copy and paste the entire script block under the definition of form, this is not good practice; instead, we can define another function "listen()" which gets called after the
ENTIRE website data structure is loaded (including the form tag and everything else) ("DOMContentLoaded), resolving any problems. The listen() function will add another listener to the form
tag listening for submissions. --->
