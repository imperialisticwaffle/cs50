A key function of Flask is to analyze the inside of "virtual envelopes", figuring out what the user input is and the route (/search, /index.html, etc.)--ultimately making these pieces of info
more accessible to you, the programmer.

Here is a framework for using Flask:
application.py  (general code)
requirements.txt  (what are the other libraries you are using in your application)
static/  (gifs, pngs, jpgs, etc.)
templates/ (html templates)

Flask uses an MVC design pattern: controller (file or files controlling the webapp) --> manipulates --> model (technique, service, or software you're using for your data) --> updates -->
view (what the human sees (html, css, UI)) --> sees --> user --> uses --> controller

Flask also allows us to factor out common content.
