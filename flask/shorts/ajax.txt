Informally, AJAX allows us to dynamically update a webpage even MORE dynamically (refresh sections of the page without refershing the WHOLE page).

We need to make use of a javascript object XMLHttpRequest to asynchronously update our website.

After obtaining the object we have to define the onreadystatechange behaviour.
    Typically this is an anonymous function that will be called when the asynchronous HTTP request has completed and defines what is expected to change on your site.
    The readystate property will change from 0 to 4 (request not yet initialized to request finished, response ready.
    The status property will hopefully be 200 (OK).
    Then, make your asynchronous request with open() to define the request and send() to actually send it.

Pure javascript usage of AJAX
function ajax_request(argument){
    var aj = new XMLHttpRequest();
    aj.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (aj.readyState == 4 && aj.status == 200) {
            // do something to page
        }
    };

    aj.open("GET", /* url */, true);
    aj.send();
}
