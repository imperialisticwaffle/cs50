Computer scientists use hexadecimals, which are expressed in base 16. We count from 0 - 9, and then use letters of the alphabet. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F (0 to 15)... etc.

Like binary, the ones are expressed in 16^0, tens are 16^1, hundreds 16^2, etc. The number 16 in hexadecimal would be 10 (1 * 16^1 + 0 * 16^0); the number 94 would be 5E.

Because hexadecimal allows you to represent 16 possible values it's perfect for representing 4 bits at a time (i.e. one hexadecimal digit = 4 binary digits).

We can also represent RGB with hex--the colour 72 73 33 using decimal values could be represented as 48 49 21 in hex. Because it's also not glaringly obvious which is decimal and which is hex,
we use the convention of adding a "0x" in front of each hex value (0x48 0x49 0x21).

You will see hex values of colours in applications like Photoshop--the absence of all colour (black) is valued at 0x000000; white is all of each colour, so the maximum is 0xFFFFFF.

By extension we can think of each byte in a computer's memory as containing a specific hex value/label, enumerated from 0 - F and so on.
