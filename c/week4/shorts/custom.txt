We can rewrite data types by using the typedef keyword; the format is as follows: typedef <old name> <new name>

Example: typedef unsigned char byte;

We can declare attributes to data types the following way:

typedef struct car (old name)
{
    int year;
    char model[10];
    char plate[7];
    int odometer;
    double engine_size;
}
car_t (new name)

Now you can declare variables of type car_t: car_t mycar
