/* C provides shorthand notation for operations on a single variable.
x = x * 5 -----> x *= 5. (This works with all 5 basic arithmetic operators, mod (%) included).

Also recall the shorthand for incrementing a variable by 1.
x++ ; x--

Any nonzero value is true; 0 is false.
Boolean expressions can be grouped into logical and relational operators.
    - Logical AND (&&)
    - Logical OR (||)
    - Logical NOT (!) inverts value of operand
    - Relational operators
        - <, >, ==, >=, <=, !=
