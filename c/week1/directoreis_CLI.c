/* Directory commands entered in the CLI: (note this works best on unix based systems like macOS or linux, and here in the CLI)
ls - lists the current files in the directory, wherein green names followed by an asterisk are executable files
mv - 'move', changes the name of the file (mv 'filename.c' 'directory_name/')
rm - remove/delete a file
rm -r <directory> - remove/delete a directory
mkdir - make directory/folder
cd - change directory
pwd - present working directory
ctrl + L = clear CLI
cp <source> <destination> - copies file
cp -r <source directory> <destination directory> - copies whole directory
