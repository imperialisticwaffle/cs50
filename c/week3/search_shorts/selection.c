// Selection sort finds the smallest unsorted element and adds it to the end of the sorted list.
Pseudocode:
Repeat until no unsorted elements remain
    Search unsorted data to find smallest value
    Swap smallest value found with first element of unsorted portion

// The runtime for selection sort is (Theta)(n^2) (O and omega are equal).
