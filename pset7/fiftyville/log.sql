-- transcripts mentions the courthouse.

-- Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might
-- want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there
-- withdrawing some money.

-- As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest
-- flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

-- We can narrow down the list of cars that were at the courthouse from 10:15 to 10:25, then attribute their license plates to people.
