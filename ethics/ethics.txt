Democratic society: political culture viewing individuals as free and equal. Citizens are committed to arriving through reflection and discourse principles that will respect their freedom and
equality.
Democratic political regime: regular elections, rights of participation, associative/expressive rights making participation both informed and effective.
Deliberative democracy: political discussions should appeal to reasons that are suitable for cooperation amongst free and equal persons.

Democracy is governed by collective decision making that respects our freedom and equality. This decision making is informed by voting, elections, and legislation, as well as the informal public
sphere (citizens identifying causes/concerns, debating solutions, etc).

Rights
As citizens of a democracy, we have the rights to basic ilberties, including expression and association. Expressive liberty is important not only for the individual but for democracy itself. It
enables citizens to bring their ideas into conversation and to criticize and hold accountable those in power.

Opportunity of expression
Should be fair for all; wealth or power shouldn't determine opportunity to participate in discussion.

Access
Each person should have equal access to quality and reliable information on public matters. If we make the effort, we should be informed.

Diversity
Each person should have good and equal chances to hear a wide range of views. 

Communicative Power
Citizens should also have equal chances to explore interests and ideas in assocation with others and develop new
concerns that challenge the mainstream view through these associations.

Each of these are lenses through which we can analyze technology.
